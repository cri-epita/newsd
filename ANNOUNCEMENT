Newsd 1.44 fixes some header parsing problems left from the
release candidates and is the first stable public release.

Newsd is a standalone local NNTP news server for private
newsgroup serving on a single server. It is useful for serving
private newsgroup(s) to an intranet or the Internet, and can act
as a simple mail gateway. However, it does not interface with
other news servers and cannot manage distributed news feeds,
i.e. Usenet news.

Changes in 1.44:

	- Important fix to multiline headers being split during
	  header reordering
	- STR#15: Path: now maintained and passed through mail
	  gateway
	- STR#16: Mailgateway: "From" field now renamed to
	  "X-Original-From: "
